# DuckyHQ Website

Official website for DuckyHQ.

This is one of my first websites that I have developed, I have made some before 2 years ago, but those were not great.
This one is fully mobile responsive, and I have learned many more features to add to this website.

The goal is for the homepage to be minimalist, and be 1 page with a grid of links that lead to other sites, or pages.
